# ScratchyBoy
Python script for porting Scratch 3 projects to Scratch 2 (don't expect it to be good)

## Usage
Run the script and select an sb3 file (Scratch 3 Project)
IMPORTANT: The costumes have to be raster graphics, not vector graphics!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## TODO
- add remaining 3-to-2 translations
- add support for selection fields (work in test_wip.py)
