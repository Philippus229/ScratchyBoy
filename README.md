# ScratchyBoy
Python script for porting Scratch 3 projects to Scratch 2 I wrote in a few hours (don't expect it to be good)

## Usage
Run the script and select a sb3 file (Scratch 3 Project)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## TODO
- add remaining blocks
- fix block inputs
- add support for control blocks (semi-functional version in test_WIP.py)
- add remaining rotation styles
